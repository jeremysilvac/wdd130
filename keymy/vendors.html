                <h2>Group buys, in-stock parts, and vendors</h2>
                <p>Group buys are a pre-order for a product before the production starts. Typically, custom keyboards and keysets are made-to-order in batch sales, which means that the manufacturer doesn’t begin production until a vendor collects purchases and places a one-time order with the factory.
                    Let’s talk about the process that they have; every group buy starts with an interest check which is when a designer checks if people are interested in their product. Then the group buy comes, this is a limited time to pre-order the product which can last between 2-4 weeks or sometimes even more. After that we get to the production of the product, this timeline is not set and sometimes delays can happen, this process alone can take 6-12 months. Once all of that is done customers receive their products.
                    There are some optional phases after some group buys such as extras, which is when vendors sell any extra products they have these are a limited quantity. We also have a R2, this happens when a highly popular set gets run as a round 2 or even 3 at some point.
                    Nowadays there are plenty of companies that constantly have in-stock products for keyboards and keycaps, this makes acquiring a nice keycap set or keyboard way easier than before. In here I will leave a list of vendors around the world that is currently selling keyboards and accessories for them!</p>
