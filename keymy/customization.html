                    <div class="explanation1">
                        <p>There are different Keyboard "Layouts", this refers to the physical size of the keyboard and therefore the amount of keys it has. In general sizes are referred to in percentages: 100%, 75%, 40%, and so on, this usually uses a full-size layout as the reference point. The most common ones are <a href="images/full.jpg" target="_blank"> full size / 100%</a>, <a href="images/TKL.jpg" target="_blank">Tenkeyless / TKL</a>, <a href="images/60.jpg" target="_blank">Compact / 60%</a>, <a href="images/primus.jpg" target="_blank">75%</a>, <a href="images/65.jpg" target="_blank">65%</a>, 40% , <a href="images/1800.jpg" target="_blank">1800 Layout</a>. In smaller sizes there will be function layers that will allow for use of key that are not there.</p>

Don't forget that when it comes to keyboards there's not such thing as "best"!, it's all personal taste, which is what makes this so unique.</p>

OEM profile: A profile with a cylindrical shape and a flat top surface, it is the most used profile and often considered the standard.<br>II. Cherry profile: A profile that is like OEM, but with a slightly lower height and a more aggressive slope.<br>III. SA profile: A tall profile with a spherical top surface, inspired by the classic Commodore 64 keyboard.<br>IV. DSA profile: A profile with a uniform height and a spherical top surface, it is popular for its minimalist design and ease of customization.<br>V. XDA profile: A profile with a uniform height and a flat top surface, it is like DSA but with a flatter profile.<br>VI. MT3 profile: A profile with a spherical top surface and a curved bottom, inspired by old terminal keyboards.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="explanation3a">
                        <p>When it comes to switches there are some different things to keep in consideration, the "type" of switch, materials, lube, even films in some cases. But worry not! when you're first diving into the world of custom keyboards the main thing to keep in consideration is essentially the type of switch you use, and nowadays there are some switches that even come pre-lubed from the factory so you won't have to deal with the lubing part (in some cases at least).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="explanation3b">
                        <h3 class="subtitle">Switch type</h3><p><h4>I. Linear switches:</h4><p>These switches have a smooth keystroke with no bump or tactile feedback. They are best for fast and precise typing.</p><h4>II. Tactile switches:</h4><p>These switches have a small bump or tactile feedback when the actuation point is reached. They are best for a balance between typing speed and feedback.</p><h4>III. Clicky switches:</h4><p>These switches have a tactile bump and an audible click sound when the actuation point is reached. They are best for a satisfying typing experience with audible feedback.</p><h4>IV. Silent swtiches:</h4><p>These switches can be either Linear or Tactile, however the difference is in the name, they are they can reduce the decibels coming from your keyboard to make it an almost completely quiet keyboard.</p>

                        <h3 class="subtitle">Parts of the switch</h3><p><h4>I. Housing</h4><p>The housing includes the bottom and top housing, the base/bottom housing has two pins that slot into the PCB, if the keyboard is a "hotswap" you only need to get it in, if not, you'll need to solder it.</p><h4>II. Stem</h4><p>The stem is positioned inside the switch housing and rests on the spring, while the '+' part fits into the underside of a keycap. Additionally, the switch's level of tactility is affected by the two legs that make contact with the metal leaf.</p><h4>III. Spring</h4><p>The spring is placed on the pole of the base housing and helps the stem move up and down. Different springs have different weights, and if the spring is heavier, it will need more strength to push the key down.</p><h4>IV. Metal leaf</h4><p>Once the switch is pressed, the stem applies pressure on the metal leaf located in the bottom housing. This results in a connection being established, and the keypress is registered on the PCB, which ultimately displays the desired characters on your computer screen.</p>

                    <div class="explanation3d">
                        <h3 class="subtitle">Lube?</h3><p>The most used grease to lube switches is Krytox 205g0, the g0 stands for grade zero, which is a measure of consistency. Grade zero is considered very smooth and optimal for lubing key switches. This is highly recommended for linear and tactile switches, for clicky switches Krytox 105 is also recommended so it can keep itâ€™s distinct sound and feel<br>Recommended tools: lube, switch puller, paintbrush, switch opener, tweezers.<br>How to lube: I highly recommend you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r15leOYG3l8&t=5s&ab_channel=alexotos" target="_blank">this</a> video by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/alexotos" target="_blank">alexotos</a> for a thorough and detailed explanation on lubing your switches</p>

                        <p><a href="https://switchandclick.com/stabilizer-guide/" target="_blank">Stabilizers</a> (often called 'stabs') are keyboard parts that prevent larger keys from wobbling when pressed. There are different types of stabs and different mounting styles within the most commonly used type (cherry style) in the custom keyboard world, which include plate mounted, screw-in and, snap-in stabs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subtitle">Tuning stabilizers</h3><p>For our stabs to sound good and not "rattly" we need to tune them, I really recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxHb6CJc9V8&ab_channel=alexotos" target="_blank">this</a> video (from alexotos) where he explains how to tune them and also gives some recommendations for them.</p>
