        Main page/intro to mechanical keyboards:<br>
        You may be wondering what’s special about a custom mechanical keyboard. Well, when it comes to the utility of the keyboard, they are exactly the same as a standard membrane keyboard and/or mechanical keyboards sold by big companies such as Razer, Logitech, Corsair, etc. Then, what’s really is so special about custom mechanical keyboards?  The answer is essentially in the name, the main benefit of them is that you get to customize the switches, keycaps, modifications, and even things like weight and accents that you put in them. When you think about modern daily life, we spend a lot of time using our computers, a lot of people even use them while working or studying, from home, an office, or school. so, I ask you this question, why not put some effort, time and money into a tool that we daily use?<br> 
        Now that you have an idea of why you’d spend some time on your keyboard, let’s talk about what exactly custom mechanical keyboards offer:
        <br>1.	Customization: Custom mechanical keyboards allow users to choose their own switch type, keycaps, and other components, which allows for a personalized typing experience.
        <br>2.	Build Quality: Custom mechanical keyboards are often built with higher-quality components, such as aluminum or stainless-steel cases, which make them more durable and longer-lasting than standard keyboards.
        <br>3.	Unique Designs: Custom mechanical keyboards can be designed to have unique layouts, colors, and styles, which can make them stand out and add a personal touch to a user's desk.
        <br>4.	Improved Typing Experience: Custom mechanical keyboards can offer a more tactile and satisfying typing experience, due to the use of mechanical switches and custom keycaps.
        <br>5.	Enhanced Functionality: Custom mechanical keyboards can have additional features such as programmable macros, dedicated media controls, and custom lighting, which can improve the overall user experience.
        <br>In summary, custom mechanical keyboards offer users the ability to create a keyboard that is tailored to their specific needs and preferences. They are often more durable, better performing, and offer a more personalized experience compared to pre-made keyboards.

      <h3>Parts and Customization</h3>
      <p>
        <br>Parts and Customization:
        <br>Different parts of them:
        <br>1.	Keyboard Sizes & Layouts
        <br>There are different Keyboard Sizes, this refers to the physical size of the keyboard and therefore the amount of keys it has. In general sizes are referred to in percentages: 100%, 75%, 40&, and so on, this usually uses a full-size layout as the reference point. The most common ones are full size / 100% (photo), Tenkeyless / TKL (photo), Compact / 60% (photo), 75% (photo), 65% (photo), 40% (photo), 1800 Layout (photo). In smaller sizes there will be function layers that will allow for use of key that are not there.
        Unconventional keyboards: Ortho, Split, Macropad.
        <br>a.	Case Material (Plastic, Polycarbonate, Aluminum, Stainless-steel, glass, wood, copper, etc.)
        <br>b.	Mounting Styles (Iso top mount, stack mount, gasket mount, lettuce mount.)
        <br>c.	Plate Materials (FR4, POM, Aluminum, PC, Carbon-fiber, Copper, Brass)
        <br>d.	Solder vs Hot swap
        <br>2.	Keycaps
        <br>a.	Profiles:
        <br>i.	OEM profile: A profile with a cylindrical shape and a flat top surface, it is the most used profile and often considered the standard.
        <br>ii.	Cherry profile: A profile that is like OEM, but with a slightly lower height and a more aggressive slope.
        <br>iii.	SA profile: A tall profile with a spherical top surface, inspired by the classic Commodore 64 keyboard.
        <br>iv.	DSA profile: A profile with a uniform height and a spherical top surface, it is popular for its minimalist design and ease of customization.
        <br>v.	XDA profile: A profile with a uniform height and a flat top surface, it is like DSA but with a flatter profile.
        <br>vi.	MT3 profile: A profile with a spherical top surface and a curved bottom, inspired by old terminal keyboards.
        <br>b.	Material
        <br>i.	ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)
        <br>ii.	PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate)
        <br>iii.	POM (Polyoxymethylene)
        <br>c.	Manufacturer 
        <br>i.	GMK
        <br>ii.	Drop
        <br>iii.	EnjoyPBT
        <br>iv.	Epomaker Akko
        <br>v.	etc.
        <br>3.	Switches
        <br>a.	Parts
        <br>i.	Top housing
        <br>ii.	Stem
        <br>iii.	Spring
        <br>iv.	Bottom housing
        <br>b.	Linear, Tactile, Clicky, Silent
        <br>i.	Linear switches: These switches have a smooth keystroke with no bump or tactile feedback. They are best for fast and precise typing.
        <br>ii.	Tactile switches: These switches have a small bump or tactile feedback when the actuation point is reached. They are best for a balance between typing speed and feedback.
        <br>iii.	Clicky switches: These switches have a tactile bump and an audible click sound when the actuation point is reached. They are best for a satisfying typing experience with audible feedback.
        <br>c.	Lube & Films
        <br>i.	The most used grease to lube switches is Krytox 205g0, the g0 stands for grade zero, which is a measure of consistency. Grade zero is considered very smooth and optimal for lubing key switches. This is highly recommended for linear and tactile switches, for clicky switches Krytox 105 is also recommended so it can keep it’s distinct sound and feel.
        <br>ii.	Tools: lube, switch puller, paintbrush, switch opener, tweezers. 
        <br>iii.	Steps to lube with pictures.
        <br>4.	Stabilizers
        <br>a.	Cherry style
        <br>b.	Plate mounted, screw-in, and, snap-in
        <br>c.	Brands (Durock, GMK, Owlab)
        <br>d.	Tuning stabilizers
        <br>5.	Community

        Group buys, in-stock parts, and vendors:
        <br>Group buys are a pre-order for a product before the production starts. Typically, custom keyboards and keysets are made-to-order in batch sales, which means that the manufacturer doesn’t begin production until a vendor collects purchases and places a one-time order with the factory.
        <br>Let’s talk about the process that they have; every group buy starts with an interest check which is when a designer checks if people are interested in their product. Then the group buy comes, this is a limited time to pre-order the product which can last between 2-4 weeks or sometimes even more. After that we get to the production of the product, this timeline is not set and sometimes delays can happen, this process alone can take 6-12 months. Once all of that is done customers receive their products. 
        <br>There are some optional phases after some group buys such as extras, which is when vendors sell any extra products they have these are a limited quantity. We also have a R2, this happens when a highly popular set gets run as a round 2 or even 3 at some point. 
        <br>Nowadays there are plenty of companies that constantly have in-stock products for keyboards and keycaps, this makes acquiring a nice keycap set or keyboard way easier than before. In here I will leave a list of vendors around the world that is currently selling keyboards and accessories for them!
